# This is the inventory file for the staging environment.

# List each hostname here on its own line. You can add
# variable definitions that are specific to that host after
# it on the same line. For example, you might want to use
# a short name to refer to a host in Ansible but set its IP
# address as a host variable so Ansible knows how to get to it,
# like this:
#
# web1 ansible_ssh_host=192.168.0.3

# EDIT THIS!
host1 ansible_ssh_host=ansible0.cakt.us

[web]
# Include web servers in this group
host1

[db]
# Include database servers in this group
host1

[worker]
# FIXME: Group must exist even if empty
